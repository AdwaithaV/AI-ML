# AI-ML
This repository contains the AI/ML projects i have worked during my undergrad studies 


**BEGINNER LEVEL PROJECTS**

 ***1)Spam Email Classifier***

Goal: Build a classifier to distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones.


Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK


Dataset: SpamAssassin or Kaggle datasets.


Learning Outcome:
Text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stemming, etc.).

Training basic classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).


Steps:
Clean and preprocess the email data.

Extract features using Bag of Words or TF-IDF.

Train and test a classifier on the dataset.


 ***2) House Price Prediction***

Goal: Predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.


Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.


Dataset: Kaggle House Prices.


Learning Outcome:

Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Building regression models.

 ***4) Handwritten Digit Recognizer***

Goal: Recognize handwritten digits using a neural network.
